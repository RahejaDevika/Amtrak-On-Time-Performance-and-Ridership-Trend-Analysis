# Amtrak On-Time Performance Analysis
This project analyzes Amtrak’s on-time performance over the past three fiscal years to uncover meaningful insights into travel patterns, service reliability, and operational trends. The goal is to identify growth opportunities and develop data-driven strategies to enhance ridership, efficiency, and customer satisfaction across Amtrak’s network.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Amtrak’s on-time performance from 2021 to 2023 to uncover key insights into travel trends, ridership patterns, and operational efficiency across U.S. states. Using a relational database design and SQL-based analysis, the project identifies factors influencing delays, evaluates budget allocation fairness, and recommends strategies to enhance ridership and service reliability.

## Tools & Techniques
* MySQL and Tableau for data analysis and visualization

* Data Cleaning & Transformation using Excel and SQL (UNPIVOT, JOINS, Aggregations)

* Database Design with ER Diagrams and Relational Schemas

* KPI Development for on-time performance, ridership, and budget efficiency

## Results & Insights

* Performance Trends: Midwest and Southern states showed the lowest on-time performance due to freight train interference and long-distance route dependencies, while Northeast Corridor states performed best.

* Ridership vs Rewards: States like Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey demonstrated high ridership aligned with growth in Amtrak Guest Rewards enrollment, showing strong loyalty potential.

* Employment Analysis: No significant correlation was found between total employment levels and train punctuality, suggesting other operational factors (like role specialization) play a larger role.

* Budget Allocation Gaps: States with major ridership increases (e.g., Kentucky +56.6%, Alabama +47.9%) received disproportionately low funding, revealing inefficiencies in budget distribution.

## Recommendations:

 * Strengthen federal enforcement of Amtrak’s right-of-way over freight trains to reduce delays.

 * Expand Guest Rewards through student-focused partnerships and better digital integration.

 * Improve budget alignment with ridership growth and infrastructure needs.

 * Categorize employees by operational role to identify workforce bottlenecks impacting service quality.
